              Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculated measure of a person's weight relative to their height. 
              It is often used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. 
              For adults aged 20 and older, including women, BMI values are typically categorised into underweight, 
              healthy weight, overweight, and obesity.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              While widely used, BMI is considered an estimate and has notable limitations, particularly when assessing 
              individuals. It should be used as one potential health indicator among many others.

            BMI is an estimate and does not take body composition into account. It measures excess body weight, 
            not specifically excess body fat. This is a significant limitation, especially for women, as factors 
            like age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass, and body fat distribution influence its accuracy.

              <p>
                Muscle tissue is denser than fat tissue. Women with high muscle mass (e.g., athletes) may have a 
                high BMI that classifies them as overweight or obese, even if they have a low body fat percentage 
                and lower health risks than someone with the same BMI but less muscle.

              <p>
                While BMI correlates with body fat levels, it doesn't distinguish where the fat is located. 
                Abdominal fat (belly fat) is a key indicator of risk for weight-related diseases. Women with a 
                moderate BMI but high abdominal fat may still be at higher risk for metabolic syndrome.

              <p>
                Body composition changes with age, with muscle mass often decreasing and belly fat increasing. 
                Hormonal changes, particularly related to menopause, can affect body composition. Postmenopausal 
                women may have high body fat percentages while maintaining a moderate BMI.

                BMI doesn't inherently distinguish between different racial or ethnic backgrounds, but body 
                composition and fat distribution can differ. For example, Asian and South Asian populations tend 
                to have more body fat relative to weight and increased health risks at lower BMI levels.

                BMI ranges themselves do not typically change with age in standard classifications for adults 20 and older. 
                However, body composition (muscle, fat, bone) changes with age and menopause, which affects how accurate 
                BMI is as an indicator of health or body fat percentage. Therefore, while the BMI number is calculated 
                the same way, its interpretation in older women or postmenopausal women requires considering these

                body composition and health risks associated with BMI can differ across racial and ethnic groups. 
                For example, different BMI cutoffs have been suggested for Asian populations due to higher body fat 
                relative to weight and increased health risks at lower BMIs. Healthcare professionals may consider a
